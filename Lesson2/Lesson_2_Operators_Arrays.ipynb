    "Arithmetic operators are operators used for math (e.g., addition, subtractions, multiplication, etc). Some of these operators will be familiar - for example, `+` and `-` are easily recognizable as \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" respectively. Others may either not be as familiar and/or differ from other languages (e.g., exponents in python are indicated using `**` whereas languages like R use the `^` operator). Here is a list of arithmetic operators in python:\n",

    "| Operator | Meaning | Example |\n",
    "| --- | :--- | --- |\n",
    "| `+` | Adding two numbers | `x + y + 2` |\n",
    "| `-` | Subtraction | `x - y - 2`|\n",
    "| `*` | Multiplication | `x * y * 2` |\n",
    "| `**` | Exponent | `x**y`|\n",
    "| `/` | Division (always results in a float) | `x/y` |\n",
    "| `//` | Floor division - division that results in nearest whole number left of the number line | `x//y` |\n",
    "| `%` | Modulus - returns the remainder of the left operand by the right | `x % y` |\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if we have a variable `x = 7` and `y = 2`, the code below will print the result of each operator applied between `x` and `y`:"

The `not in` operator returns `True` if the element is *not* found in the tuple - e.g., `'three' not in ('one','two')` returns `True`."

For example, I have a list `my_list = [1,2,3,['one','two']]` that has three numbers and one list as elements - if I wanted to obtain the second element of the list within my list, I would use nested indexing to first specify the index of the element of the main list I want, then the sub-index of the second list `my_list[3][1]`, which would return `'two'`.\n",

I can assign the value `555-5555` to the key `Jane Smith` - the way this is done is within the curly braces with the key coming first, then the value after a colon: `numbers = {'Jane Smith':'555-5555'}`.
